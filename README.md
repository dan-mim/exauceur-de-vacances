# exausseur-de-vacances
This is the first web app I am developping. It often happens that I know when I can have some hollidays but I never know where to go. This usually depends on the price flights. This app proposes all the best destination option.

The difference between this branche and the other is that in the version, the website runs the scraping in background and send a message byy itself while the client can do other requests.
